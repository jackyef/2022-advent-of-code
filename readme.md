### 2022 Advent Of Code

Collection of TypeScript code to solve 2022 Advent Of Code problems.

Problem for each days are contained under `src/problems/day*`. You can change the input by replacing `input.txt` with your own input.

Each day has a 2-part problem, the script for each part can be run separately.

We use `ts-node` with `swc` to run each script.

```sh
# Running script to solve part 1 of day 3 problem
pnpm ts-run src/problems/day3/part1

# Running script to solve part 2 of day 3 problem
pnpm ts-run src/problems/day3/part2
```
